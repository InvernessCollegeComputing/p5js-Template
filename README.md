# p5js-Template

A blank template to get you started with p5js in a third party editor like Brackets.

## Getting Started

This blank template will let you get started in a third party editor like Brackets. 

Before you do any programming, copy and paste the folder and give it a sensible name. By default the javascript file is called 'sketch.js'. For now, just leave it like that. 

If you do want to rename it, you'll also need to edit line 11 of the index.html file to reflect the change in filename.
